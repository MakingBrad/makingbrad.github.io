         <p class="jobdescription"> Rapid Interface is the "Brand" that sells the outputs from our 
            developed printing solution.  The main offering was membrane switches and keypads.  
            The auxillary offering was industrial labels and overlays.  We spent a tremendous amount 
            of time and money developing a website for online ordering and direct to factory floor 
            production.  I failed at this miserably due to a lack of knowledge and experience. <p>

        <p class="jobdescription"> We realized that Rapid Interface was serving a market that was too 
           small to "keep the lights on". We repurposed equipment we have to sell vinyl stickers and 
           compete with online sellers like "Sticker Mule".  Our website is very stripped down and 
           simple - we use "Big Cartel".  <p>

        <p class="jobdescription"> My role was to research technologies that may create a major shift in 
          wide format image presentation, or in printing. I created prototype "proof of concept" projects
          in a number of technologies. The amount of innovation taking place in this vertical market 
          (large image production and large image presentation) is breathtaking. Out of respect for

        <p class="jobdescription"> My role at Showdown Displays changed to product development after the 
          merging of Creative Banner and Showdown Displays. When the companies merged it was run under the
          name Sign-Zone Inc.  My focus became product development (in stead of product management). 
          It was a focus on product-concept creation for market deploy able products. I collaborated 
          with many designers, and fabrication companies to get ideas off of the drawing board and 
          into the market. In this role I was fortunate to have the freedom needed to learn from my mistakes.
          -I learned about the process of product development, design through production. <p>

      <p class="jobdescription"> Showdown Displays is the country's leading provider of printed visual 
          communication products. The phrase "we take large printing vertical" is quite literal, as we 
          have structural systems that allow our flexible printing solutions to be visible as you walk by
          them... common applications include pop-up displays and banner stands, as well as table covers. 
          In this position I learned about offshore sourcing, common industrial processes (plastic 
          injection molding, plastic vac forming, aluminum extruding, industrial sewing) as well as wide 
          format printing processes (dye sublimation, Aqueous printing, Latex printing, UV cure printing, 
          laminating, 2D CNC cutting).
          -I learned about more manufacturing technologies than I can list here, and why they matter.<p>

        extrusion systems (Octanorm/Agam) it was meant to simplify the customization of a display's 
        silhouette and footprint. As remarkable a product as it was, Edge Exhibits discontinued it, 
        as it did not fit with their core competencies.
